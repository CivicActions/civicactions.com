As the technological landscape continues to evolve and public expectation for government digital services increases, procurement officers need to learn how current regulations can be adapted to modular contracts and software development best practices.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Digital Service and Office of Federal Procurement Policy created the Digital Information Technology Acquisitions Professional (DITAP) program as a pilot community of informed IT procurement specialists to build expertise across Federal agencies. CivicActions offers DITAP training to support the development of modern acquisition strategies for digital transformation.</p>\n<h3>Who is DITAP Training For?</h3>\n<p>Starting in 2022, all Federal acquisition professionals managing contracts of $7M or greater will need the <a href="https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/FAC_C_Digital_Services_5-18-18.pdf">FAC-C-DS certification</a> provided by DITAP training. Whether or not you need a certification, learning about modern digital services delivery can benefit many agency leaders, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Procurement Officials</strong> seeking to develop expertise in modern IT contracts</li>\n<li><strong>Project and Program Managers</strong> learning to structure projects for digital service delivery</li>\n<li><strong>Legal teams</strong> advising agencies on FOSS licensing and digital services contracts</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Managers</strong> approaching new open source and shared technology services</li>\n<li><strong>Finance Officers</strong> looking to maximize technology investments</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Our Approach</h3>\n<h4>Expert, invested coaches</h4>\n<p>Our team of design and technology experts is committed to transforming how government procures, develops, and delivers digital services. CivicActions DITAP training is shaped by years of work alongside state and federal staff on modern IT projects.</p>\n<h4>Blended learning environments</h4>\n<p>Focused in-person classroom sessions form the foundation for extended learning online. </p>\n<h4>Community-oriented learning</h4>\n<p>CivicActions DITAP trainings are modeled on the same culture of open collaboration and learning that supports effective digital service delivery. Learners connect with peers in the acquisition community so they can benefit from shared knowledge and support.</p>\n<h3>Courses</h3>\n<h4>DITAP Foundation</h4>\n<p>The DITAP Foundation course is for learners seeking to lead change in digital service procurement. This course fulfills the requirements of the <strong>FAC-C-DS Certification</strong>.

We performed a technical architecture redesign which uses Drupal 8 custom entities to treat the data as if it were local. </p>\n<h5>Design with users in mind</h5>\n<p>User research helped us decide on a modern, responsive design that gives people a flawless experience on any device and can be customized for each new state.</p>\n<h5>Unlimited growth potential</h5>\n<p>We used a design evaluation process to create an expandable, dynamic solution that makes real-time data possible. The previous cumbersome data import process is eliminated, and the site can now scale to support any number of states.</p>\n<h5>DevOps for reliable updates</h5>\n<p>We put DevOps processes in place for building, testing, and releasing to make sure the platform could be updated without compromising stability. Digital Democracy development teams can focus on improving the platform rather than managing problems.</p>\n<h5>Built for sharing</h5>\n<p>We revamped Digital Democracy as a “white label solution,” available as an API to other groups and organizations looking for a similar tool to power their own advocacy efforts. </p>\n<h5>Powerful, effective search</h5>\n<p>We built a simple but powerful site-wide search feature so users can quickly find what they’re looking for. People can search for topics, speakers, committees, bills, and more — right from the home screen.</p>\n<h5>Helping people take action</h5>\n<p>Digital Democracy was built to double as an “Action Center.” Organizers can create campaigns focused on a particular bill by presenting clips of hearings, downloads, and other message-boosting content.</p>\n<blockquote>\nDigital Democracy empowers every Californian with unprecedented access to their government.

In turn, county staff members and community based organizations promoted the project to their constituents as a valuable service.</p>\n<h5>Serving a diverse population</h5>\n<p>Because EatFresh users speak multiple languages and use both phones and computers to access the internet, we built a site that users could access smoothly on any device in English, Spanish and Chinese. SMS features make it easy for users to share and save recipes by texting them directly from the site.</p>\n<h5>Location-based advice</h5>\n<p>We built the EatFresh site with the ability to auto-detect a person’s location so users can see geographically-specific resources like local farmers markets and nearby county offices. This helps remove barriers to accessing health services and nutritious foods.</p>\n<h5>Talk with real users</h5>\n<p>Our team interviewed county-level staff, food bank managers, and potential users at the HSA food stamp office to find out what was most important to them. We conducted usability testing and gathered feedback throughout the project.</p>\n<h5>Get the word out</h5>\n<p>To help spread awareness about EatFresh, we created a print campaign so people could be informed through postcards, bus posters, and flyers. We targeted our efforts toward the populations that would most benefit from the program.</p>\n<blockquote>\nI’ve gotten very positive and impressed feedback since the site’s launch.

The user experience of FCC.gov is now as intuitive as modern consumer sites.</p>\n<h5>Simplified content management</h5>\n<p>We added access control to allow FCC’s many content creators to manage their own content without compromising the integrity of the site’s design. We also helped make the creation of content more pleasant and efficient by adding a robust text editor.</p>\n<h5>Accessibility for all users</h5>\n<p>FCC serves users with all levels of ability and is itself responsible for the accessibility of 21st century communications. We adhered to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> in scanning and updating the site for compliance and usability.</p>\n<h5>Testing to ensure quality code</h5>\n<p>To make sure all new code worked properly, we used Behat, a behavior-driven development testing framework that is written in English and can double as user acceptance test criteria. Behat tests were configured to automatically run when new code was merged. </p>\n<h5>Turn-key solution for deployment</h5>\n<p>Due to security restrictions, we could not have full access to the production server, which made deployment of the new site complicated.

Our agile process kept the GlobalNET project efficient and on budget.</p>\n<h5>Smooth content migration</h5>\n<p>We developed an automatic migration of 550,000 pages, 589,040 files, and 65,000 user accounts from a legacy Drupal 6 site into a fully redesigned Drupal 7 site. A rolling launch schedule helped us minimize downtime for users.</p>\n<h5>Responsive and “mobile-first” design</h5>\n<p>GlobalNET participants need to use sophisticated community tools in a variety of situations, so we built the platform using a “mobile-first” approach, ensuring its accessibility on any device from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<h5>Security is never “done”</h5>\n<p>Adhering to strict DoD guidelines ensures that we meet DSCA’s unique security needs. We not only follow all compliance regulations, we regularly work to improve security processes, compensate for possible weakness, and plan for emergencies.</p>\n<h5>Thoughtful design and helpful support</h5>\n<p>Talking to GlobalNET users helps us learn what is most important to them before we create new features. As a result of user feedback, we restructured tools, interfaces, and search experiences to make the platform more intuitive and useful, while providing enhanced support for end-user problems.</p>\n<h5>Tools for learning and sharing</h5>\n<p>We created tools and groups to help DSCA partners work together online. Teachers can share their syllabus, course materials, and announcements, while students can participate in discussions and upload coursework. Each user has a personalized dashboard to keep track of messages, contacts, courses, and events.</p>\n<h5>DevOps for continuous improvement</h5>\n<p>We used open source tools for continuous integration and continuous delivery, helping DSCA establish DevOps practices. The agency can continue to improve GlobalNET in the future while maintaining strong security and quality code.</p>\n<h5>Sharing our work</h5>\n<p>We used 100% open source licensed components (except EZproxy and Adobe Connect) to develop GlobalNET. The entire codebase was itself released as an <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/globalnet">open source project</a> for review or comment by other folks who would benefit from a similar system.</p>\n<blockquote>\nIt was a pleasure to work with the CivicActions team.

By communicating regularly with stakeholders, we made sure there were no surprises, and could quickly adjust course when needed. Rapid iteration allowed us to test ideas before they were built into the final product.</p>\n<h5>Integrated tools to reach people world-wide</h5>\n<p>We worked with Smithsonian to create a social media strategy and online tools that would allow people all over the world to vote for new 3-D content and participate in discussions taking place at the museum.</p>\n<h5>Interactive features to keep things interesting</h5>\n<p>We built the site with features to keep audiences engaged beyond their museum experience. People can keep learning online through an interactive floor plan of the exhibit, 3-D viewer, and educator’s section with a forum and lesson plans.</p>\n<h5>Security for public institutions</h5>\n<p>Our careful security process and and documentation allowed Human Origins to be the first website to successfully pass The Smithsonian Institution Office of Chief Information Officer and Security Committee’s review.</p>\n<h5>Planning for future growth</h5>\n<p>By transitioning the site to the Smithsonian Institution’s in-house servers and providing support and training to staff, we ensured the Human Origins site could be easily maintained after its launch.

We showed agency staff how to make their data as useful and findable as possible.</p>\n<h5>Telling stories to help veterans</h5>\n<p>We helped USVA create maps and visualizations — “data stories” — that make the data more accessible to the average person. From opioid prescription rates to equity for minority vets, data stories act as compelling narratives to help people identify patterns and solutions.</p>\n<h5>Custom tools for accurate data</h5>\n<p>We helped USVA improve the accuracy of its data by creating a <a href="http://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/linkchecker.html">link checker</a> that tracks down broken URLs and helps prevent future errors. We also made reports to help USVA staff curate the datasets that are frequently added by the agency’s sub-departments.</p>\n<h5>What is the most useful data?</h5>\n<p>USVA creates a staggering amount of data during its daily operations, but not all of it is actually valuable to the public. We trained agency staff on the use of website analytics so they can better understand which datasets and data stories are most frequently viewed.</p>\n<h5>Mobile and printer friendly</h5>\n<p>USVA was struggling with charts and data stories that were impossible to display properly on a mobile device or as a PDF. We made improvements to ensure that all the department’s data would be mobile accessible and printer-friendly.</p>\n<h5>Keeping good data records</h5>\n<p>The USVA data portal houses thousands of datasets. We trained agency staff to use DKAN’s <a href="http://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/components/harvest.html">harvest module</a> to create accurate records for data that is frequently updated.</p>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Researchers, developers, and policy makers can use VA data to improve outcomes for veterans</li>\n<li>USVA open data is more accurate and up-to-date</li>\n<li>Interactive data stories make it easier for the general public to understand the data</li>\n<li>People can access veteran-related data in printer- or mobile-friendly formats</li>\n<li>USVA staff are better prepared to identify, upload, and manage the most important data</li>\n<li>Improvements to the USVA open data platform will benefit other agencies using DKAN</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Explore</h3>\n<h5>See the data</h5>\n<p><a href="https://www.data.va.gov/">Data.va.gov</a>  </p>\n<h5>Learn about DKAN open data</h5>\n<p><a href="https://getdkan.org/">Visit getDKAN.org</a></p>\n<h5>How data can help veterans</h5>\n<p><a href="https://www.data.va.gov/story/department-veterans-affairs-opioid-prescribing-data">Data to combat the opioid epidemic</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.data.va.gov/story/national-cemetery-administration">Final resting places that honor veterans</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.data.va.gov/story/national-veteran-health-equity-report">Health equity report to protect vulnerable veterans</a>  </p>\n<figure>\n  <div> \n    <header>160,000</header>\n    <p>people visited<br>data.va.gov in 2017<p>\n    \n  </div>\n  <div> \n      <header>3,739</header>\n      <p>datasets housed<br>on data.va.gov<p>\n  </div>\n</figure>`,

We provided customized in-person and online training to CDT legal, technical, and procurement staff.</p>\n<h5>Showing the business value of FOSS</h5>\n<p>We helped CDT translate the new policy into value propositions to ensure FOSS was adopted in earnest throughout the organization. We showed how free and open source software can increase IT security and allows agencies to make sure their custom code is providing the best value to the public.</p>\n<h5>Making legal advice palatable</h5>\n<p>Since FOSS differs from traditional proprietary licensing, we provided training on legal concepts, organizational policies, and compliance strategies. We tailored the training to be useful and understandable to technical and procurement teams, not just legal staff.</p>\n<h5>Open source best practices will inform new guidelines</h5>\n<p>We showed CDT how other agencies are successfully using FOSS in the United States and abroad. Building on these best practices, CDT and other agencies can create their own checklists and guidelines for managing FOSS products and contracts going forward.</p>\n<h5>Building an open culture</h5>\n<p>We helped CDT create a judgment-free environment where legal, technical, and procurement staff can collaborate and see the value of one another’s efforts. A culture of openness and appreciation facilitates faster adoption of new practices and a FOSS philosophy within the organization.</p>\n<h5>Software by the people, for the people</h5>\n<p>Free and open source software helps people see what technology the government is using to serve the public -- and how it can be improved. By creating opportunities to contribute to public sector projects, CDT encourages folks to take ownership and work together to build better digital services for California.</p>\n<h5>Open code for stronger communities</h5>\n<p>By embracing FOSS at the state level, CDT makes it easier for California counties and cities to reuse code, lower costs, and increase their own engagement with the public. The state can also bring value to communities and create local jobs by allowing developers to work remotely on open source projects.</p>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Agency is prepared to comply with state policy requiring FOSS adoption</li>\n<li>Staff builds on open source best practices to create their own guidelines</li>\n<li>CDT saves money by avoiding the recurring costs of vendor lock-in</li>\n<li>Technical, legal, and procurement staff gain working knowledge of FOSS </li>\n<li>Open source code created by CDT can be re-used by counties and cities</li>\n<li>CDT can verify the security and efficacy of its own code</li>\n<li>California residents benefit from a more transparent, accountable government</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Explore</h3>\n<h5>Discover helpful resources</h5>\n<p><a href="https://opentechstrategies.com/#resources">Resources for managing open source projects</a></p>\n<figure>\n  <div> \n    <header>17</header>\n    <p>high-level CDT execs attended<br>in-person FOSS training<p>\n  </div>\n  <div> \n      <header>482</header>\n      <p>cities in California that<br>can benefit from FOSS<p>\n  </div>\n</figure>`,
