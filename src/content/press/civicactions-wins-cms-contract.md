The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Feb. 28 awarded CivicActions a $18.25 million contract for Web Experience and Content Management Services (WECMS), according to USASpending.gov.

The digital services agency, which started in 2004, specializes in user centered design, Drupal development, open data, and DevOps. CivicActions is also the core maintainer of DKAN.
The contract starts on March 2, 2020 and has two, one-year options to extend the project to June 1, 2023, up to a total of $18.25 M. 
Earlier this year, the firm was named to the GovTech Top 100 list for the fourth year in a row.
