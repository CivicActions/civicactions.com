[CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) is pleased to announce that in partnership with [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team/) we have won a contract with the U.S. Library of Congress to support its Agile Development and System Integration modernization initiative.

This 5-year, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will support the planning, design, development, integration, and maintenance of Library IT systems and software applications.

Our work began this month on the Digital Library Services project, which aims to make collections of historic and public documents more accessible to everyone online.
