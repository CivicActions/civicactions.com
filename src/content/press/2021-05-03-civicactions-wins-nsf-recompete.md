---
Date: May 3, 2021

[CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) is pleased to announce that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has [awarded us a 5-year contract](https://etc.g2xchange.com/statics/small-business-scores-44m-nsf-web-content-management-system-cms-support-contract/) at $44M to continue working with the agency using human-centered and agile approaches to improve how their website serves the scientific community.

This will include further improvement of NSF’s web content management system (CMS) through human-centered development, modernization, and enhancement (DME); and ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M). We are delighted to help support the agency’s mission of advancing scientific research and discovery applied to practical problems.

Our work is slated to begin in spring 2021.  This work was awarded through our General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) [contract](https://civicactions.com/static/GSA-Schedule-4e514f0b565633ef0deb324b31abb6e9.pdf). 

Our previous work with NSF has taken a research-based approach to the redesign and modernization of the agency’s website, including the design and development of an improved search feature that easily connects science researchers with opportunities to obtain funding for their work.
