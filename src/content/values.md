### Work for the greater good
We seek projects that make life better for people. This means we welcome tough challenges and excel at solving both technical and business related problems. We take time to define how human needs will be met through the services we create.

### Embrace new thinking
We stay informed about new trends and technologies to provide the best value for our clients and employees. We have the courage to experiment because it leads to faster learning and innovation. And we’re committed to continuous improvement.

### Be agile in all things
For us, agile is more than a development or project management approach. It’s a way of thinking that requires us to be flexible, transparent, and user-focused in every aspect of our daily work. We regularly reflect on our processes and are willing to embrace change when necessary.

### Take responsibility
Contributing to public sector projects comes with an obligation to take responsibility for our actions and stand for what is right. We work to create opportunities for underrepresented groups, honor our commitments, and do the little things well.

### Promote openness and transparency
We communicate honestly and clearly. We actively share our work and insights with each other, with clients, and with our communities so everyone can benefit. We work in the open whenever possible and prioritize open source public licenses over proprietary solutions.

### Show appreciation
We are intentional about showing appreciation for each other and for those we serve. By celebrating the talents and efforts of the people around us, we encourage them to learn new things and grow as leaders. We also designate time for ourselves to give back to the various communities we are part of.

### Maintain balance
We believe people work more effectively when they feel healthy and balanced. We create a positive work culture by adhering to business practices that support physical and emotional well-being. And we honor the priorities we have set for ourselves in our personal, professional, and spiritual lives.
