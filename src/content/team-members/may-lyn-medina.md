May Lyn is in her element when all the numbers add up at the end of the day.

She brings efficiency and enthusiasm to the administrative side of CivicActions, applying over 12 years of experience with bookkeeping, billing, customer care, and data entry. She also helps “sell the team” by keeping a constantly evolving set of staff resumes current.

May Lyn has a B.S. in Accounting from University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos and has worked in far-flung areas of the Island of Negros, Philippines as a microfinance loan officer. She also maintains a sizable collection of sporty shoes and leggings owing to her unexpected romance with Zumba.
