Andrew approaches problems from a cosmic perspective.

As an open source technology entrepreneur, he builds partnerships and creates tools that help governments work toward a decentralized, egalitarian, and democratic planet. Andrew co-founded the organization that created [DKAN](https://getdkan.org/), an open source platform for hundreds of government open data sites worldwide, and continues to serve the DKAN open data community at its new home at CivicActions.

Andrew has an M.S. in Environmental Science from the University of California Berkeley and a B.S. in Planetary Science from Brown University. He served as the first-ever Chief Information Officer of the New York State Senate and was named State CIO of the Year in 2010. He is a blockchain enthusiast and loves traveling to places with mountains and snow.
