Cameron loves all things innovation.

He got an early start in the IT field as a system administrator for the first internet service provider in North Alabama, and taught himself just about everything he knows along the way. Now he’s a Drupal old-timer and skilled back-end engineer who has worked with a wide range of clients, including design firms, hosting companies, and government contractors.

Cameron is an Acquia certified Drupal engineer and devoted Nikola Tesla historian who makes occasional appearances on TV to elevate the accomplishments and memory of the scientist-inventor. He enjoys building his own Tesla-powered inventions in his workshop in Alabama, where he lives with his cat, 2 dogs, and 7 children.
