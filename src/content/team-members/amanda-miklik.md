Amanda wants to help you make the world better.

They care deeply about people, and help project teams stay focused on users with empathy-driven UX design and content strategy. Amanda’s background in social justice organizing and higher education gives them insight into how people experience systems as a whole, which inspired their work at the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/). They tackle systemic problems with jargon-busting plain language, a keen organizational sensibility, and plenty of user research.

Amanda studied Adult Learning and Social Justice at Metropolitan State University and has an M.Ed. in Learning Technologies from University of Minnesota. They’ve also worked as a professional chef and baker, and have been known to facilitate "milk-and-cookies storytime" at community meetings. They also enjoy pottery, fiber arts, and collecting new hobbies.
