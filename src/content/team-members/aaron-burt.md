Aaron is shy but loves meeting new people and learning new things.

An advocate for strong DevOps and agile practices that prioritize the end-user, Aaron helps build and maintain systems that underpin the work of developers and designers. He strives to share knowledge so he’s not the only one who knows how to do his job. Undiscouraged by an early rejection letter from Richard Stallman, he’s been working with Free and Open Source software since 1999.

Aaron has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Portland State University and a CCNA certification. His bouncy enthusiasm and eagerness have earned him the nickname “Tigger” among certain colleagues. He shares his wife’s interests in draft horses and organic farming, adores chickens and goats, and is learning Danish.
