Ari’s roots in creativity and computing go deep. 

She’s been typing since before she could talk, and grew up working in the multimedia world of film and video, where she was drawn to the technical side of aesthetics. Ari delights in the colors, shapes, and elaborate navigation effects that make sites beautiful, and practices Atomic Design Principles to form a modular technical foundation that makes it easy for a site to grow. Above all, Ari values the opportunity to bring her front-end flair to work that contributes to the greater good.

Ari is an experienced Drupaler and has been working as an IT professional since she was a teenager. A perennial self-professed nerd, she enjoys board gaming, mixing records, hiking, drawing, and traveling the country with her dogs Tango and Bella.
