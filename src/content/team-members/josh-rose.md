Josh thrives on difficult problems.

He’s a generalist, with full-stack development skills and a knack for troubleshooting. His technical expertise and ease with clients make him good at resolving sticky project issues. (His dry sense of humor helps too!) Josh brings an epic calm to client interactions, building trust and breaking big challenges into solve-able parts. He also serves as a mentor to help junior developers gain skill and confidence.

Josh has a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Oregon and is a certified Drupal 8 developer. In life, as in code, his interests are wide ranging — he loves making music and visual art, nerding out about sports, and occasionally playing golf.
