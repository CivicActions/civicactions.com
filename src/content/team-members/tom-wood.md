Tom loves to use code as a tool for positive change. 

He’s been speaking programming languages ever since his first communication with the only computer on Long Island in the 7th grade. Since then, Tom has become a proficient agile developer (especially with Python), and values functionality in code above all else. He relates well to both humans and computers, and works to build healthy relationships between them by advocating for DevOps processes that result in better security and stability.

Tom has a degree in Applied Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University. He is a certified Scrum Master, loves bicycling and beer brewing, and can’t wait to take his remote job even more remote — on his next trip to Italy.
