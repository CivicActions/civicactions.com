Chianti is a lifter-upper.
 
She raises organizations and communities to their highest potential by focusing on the people. An adept communicator from an early age, Chianti has always worked to make the world better -- she even starred in a public service commercial about saving the environment as a Girl Scout in elementary school! 

Since then, Chianti has built over a decade of expertise helping large-scale organizations transform their culture, leaders, and employees through human-centered training approaches. At CivicActions she supports the Digital IT Acquisition Professional ([DITAP](https://civicactions.com/education-services)) program to help federal contracting officers buy modern technology to bring better government services to the American public. 

Chianti has a B.A. in Organization and Corporate Communication and is a certified Personal and Executive Coach. Although she likes to re-charge her batteries in solitude with podcasts and snuggly blankets, she enjoys the human connection of open mic poetry readings, live music, and game nights with friends. She’s also a former instructor for an inclusive yoga class called “My Body Don’t Bend That Way!”
