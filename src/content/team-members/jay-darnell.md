Jay strives to help people connect with technology for a more humane and sustainable planet.

A versatile engineer, Jay is the guy who can do what needs to be done in a pinch — front and back end development, theming, programming, and especially problem solving. He has a knack for explaining technical concepts to non-technical people and brings unquenchable optimism to every project. Serving schools and government agencies, he’s dedicated his career to making technology more accessible and useful for humans.

Jay has a B.S. in Computer Science from Southwest Baptist University and over nine years of Drupal experience. He loves creating and discovering with his kids — whether camping in the woods, geeking out about astronomy, or making digital illustrations of superheroes and robots.
