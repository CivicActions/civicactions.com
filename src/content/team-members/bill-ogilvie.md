Bill keeps our team laughing and our business thriving.

Seasoned in the workings of government, his friendliness and keen sense of strategy help CivicActions maintain healthy partnerships with federal organizations. He pays attention to the public sector innovation landscape, giving our team opportunities to improve the way government buys and implements technology.

Bill has a B.S. from the University of Central Oklahoma. Now that his kids are grown, he’s transferred his love of sports from coaching Rugby to hiking. Bill can be found walking wherever there is a good (or not-so-good) trail.
