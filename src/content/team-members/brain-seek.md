Brian is an explorer of the world around him.

His evolving path as a skilled full-stack developer is driven by an exuberant curiosity for learning how things are built. He’s designed hydroponic systems, drafted maps and technical drawings, fixed myriad mechanical objects, and tried his hand with all things digital — including content writing, marketing, and site building. There’s not much Brian doesn’t enjoy doing within the development stack, and he applies his talents to projects that help others.

Brian is a self-taught Drupal whiz, and learns best by diving into something hands-on. When he’s not squashing bugs and messing with code, you can find him working on his beloved Mercury Comet, [a jalopy of a 2-door station wagon.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Osg_-brEzUEjN48yPFmrySKmFCi3TNf)
