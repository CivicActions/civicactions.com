Tony is a champion of technology for the public good.

He’s passionate about investing public resources in open source code to keep technology shareable and extensible. After 30 years providing technical and organizational strategy to government, nonprofit, and corporate entities, he’s now focused on empowering the next generation of leaders. At CivicActions, Tony mentors government IT staff in learning how to modernize digital services with agile development and free and open source software. 

Tony attended the Center for Writers at University of Southern Mississippi before catching the entrepreneurial bug. But he still retains his love of literature — he enjoys mid-20th century novels and the tools of the craft: [mechanical keyboards](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional-for-mac/), [typewriters](http://mytypewriter.com/), quality [pens](https://www.penaddict.com/top-5-pens/), and the great [pencil](https://blackwing602.com/) used by John Steinbeck.
