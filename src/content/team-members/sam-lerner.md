Sam loves technology as a multidisciplinary art form.

His uncontainable curiosity and knack for problem solving got him involved in IT early in life — he was working as a developer even before he got his driver’s license. Now Sam applies his boundless energy and wide-ranging technical experience to helping our government clients build Drupal-powered sites optimized for performance. 

Sam has a B.S. in Electronic Media, Arts, and Communication from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and is an Acquia certified Drupal 8 developer. He’s fascinated by synaesthetic experiences, and takes a multisensory approach to pursuing his many concurrent interests. Right now he’s thinking about pushing the limits of the web as a publishing platform, creating works of multisensory theater, raising emus, the future of web VR, and the chemistry of baking bread.  




### Things Sam has been doing
* Supporting [Doctors Without Borders’](https://civicactions.com/case-study/msf) new site to raise support to deliver global aid
* Helping shape technical direction for [a leading open source software firm](https://www.acquia.com/)
