Jeff believes that empowering government to deliver user-centered software is key to making the world a better place. He talks with users, simplifies systems and processes, writes code to make things work, and frequently re-reads the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/).

Jeff’s first priority in a project is to identify important outcomes and how folks can work to achieve them in small, iterative, repeatable steps. From there, he works towards delivery. He encourages his teams to continually learn, listen, and pivot based on new information as they go. 

Jeff was an early member of the US Digital Service and founding engineering manager of the Vets.gov team. He has also worked with several state digital service teams in California, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.
