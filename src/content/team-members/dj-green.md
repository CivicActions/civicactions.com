DJ brings quiet attention and committed focus to meeting users’ needs.

He’s a thoughtful designer with a passion for process and specialized skills in visual design. DJ often starts with sketches on paper, relishing the early stages of the design process where ideas begin to bloom. You might not hear much from DJ at first — he’s a deep listener, and pays close attention to the nuances in a project that others may have missed. He is a natural helper who enjoys government projects because he can work closely with the people his designs serve. 

DJ has a B.F.A. in Interactive Media and Design from the University of the Incarnate Word. He loves drawing, and is fascinated by the patent sketches inventors create to demonstrate their ideas. Outside of work, DJ invests in all sorts of other creative projects — taking photographs, building his own furniture, collecting fly custom sneakers, and raising two daughters.
