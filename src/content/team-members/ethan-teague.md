Ethan loves cracking code and cracking jokes.

At CivicActions he specializes in custom backend Drupal development, applying over ten years of experience to create platforms that meet the specific (often complex) needs of federal clients. He loves solving code-related puzzles and is always willing to lend a hand to others on the team. He’s also helped develop best practices for automation and DevOps on CivicActions projects.
 
Ethan has a B.A. in English Literature from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. When taking a break from his laptop, he enjoys playing bluegrass music and watching bad 80s movies with his wife and three kids.
