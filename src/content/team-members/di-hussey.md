Di thrives on challenges.

She helps the proposal team navigate complex layers of requirements to match CivicActions’ services with client needs. Di’s optimism makes insight seem like common sense, but don’t be fooled — her adept management comes from over a decade of experience with contracts and proposals. 

Di has an AA in Business Administration with a minor in English from California State University, Sacramento. She is a certified Scrum Master and has a certificate in Human Centered Design.   Di is a California enthusiast — she loves the beauty and culture of her native state, where she lives with her two cats, Prada and Pinto Bean.
