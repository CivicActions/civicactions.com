Bob loves working with creative teams on intractable problems.

He’s a veteran of public-sector projects, full of tales of IT triumph and daring ideas (ask him about the time his wayward [public engagement project](https://web.archive.org/web/20021011101430/http://www.techrocks.org:80/index.lasso) generated a proposal to shut down the White House email system for a week — using seven Macs and a good internet connection). But seriously: he knows what it takes to get people working together to create long-term change. His development expertise comes with well-formed technical documentation and practical project management skills.

Bob has a B.A. from American University in Washington, D.C. and was recognized as Best Public Interest Developer by [NTEN](https://www.nten.org/) in 2002. He loves outdoor sports like kayaking, fishing, and sailing — and has spent considerable time perfecting the art of making brick oven pizza at high altitudes.
