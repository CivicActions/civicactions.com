Kate strikes just the right tone.

That’s no easy task when helping large, content-heavy organizations find their voice, but Kate brings the right tools for the job. She uses style guides, clear documentation, and user research to make sure content is approachable and helps people find what they need. Kate thrives on mission-driven work, and discovered the power of civic tech to improve lives while working at 18F. As the organization’s first content strategist, she founded the [18F Writing Lab](https://handbook.18f.gov/writing-lab/) to facilitate quality content and collaboration across departments.

Kate has a B.A. in Creative Writing and German and an M.F.A. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. When she’s not finding poetry in the mico-copy of user interfaces, she writes her own poetry and fiction and volunteers in the literary community. She enjoys cooking, hiking, and bringing the outdoors inside with her growing collection of taxidermy and bones.
