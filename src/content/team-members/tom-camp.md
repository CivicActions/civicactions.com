Tom loves solving puzzles and squashing bugs (the programming kind).
 
As an engineer and “professional troubleshooter,” he inspires colleagues and clients with his unique approach — 60% patience, 30% creativity, and 10% humor. There’s nothing he can’t tackle with his decade of Drupal experience and broad range of technical and interpersonal skills. He is a champion listener and communicates well with just about anybody — from clients and stakeholders to programmers and designers. He draws from his experience in nonprofit work to support and empathize with the government agencies he now serves. 
 
Tom is a bartender-turned-developer and a self-taught expert in his field who still appreciates a well crafted cocktail. He loves getting outside with his wife to explore Colorado’s stunning wilderness — and he actually enjoys shoveling snow.
