Jonathan loves “the do-gooder stuff.” 

He’s been helping non profit organizations realize their visions with digital solutions for many years, and brings creative curiosity and enthusiasm to every job that makes a positive impact on society. Jonathan is a versatile developer with a solid design background, and he’s held just about every role on a digital services team. Whether he’s working on something strictly technical or abstract and strategic, you can count on him to keep the larger goal at the center of his work.

Jonathan has a B.A. in English and Spanish from Rice University and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from Sarah Lawrence College. Somewhere along the way he traded his art nerd badge for techie credentials. Since then he’s run his own digital agency, maintains a personal collection of robots, and enjoys the geekiest of board games.
