Alina is the ultimate people person.

Her optimism, warmth, and enthusiasm for deep thinking energizes clients and users to get involved in the central questions of design. By asking, ‘what are the actual human needs we need to address?’ she helps teams build services informed by research and empathy for the users. Alina’s design process starts with visual sketches, and she uses her background in brand and communications to chart solutions that balance user needs and organizational goals.

Alina has nearly a decade of mission-driven design experience, and is an MBA candidate in Design Strategy at California College of the Arts. She’s a constant source of high-voltage positive vibes, which comes from her full embrace of the pleasures in life. For Alina, that’s ecstatic dance, spiritual practices, cooking, travel, languages, and her cat.
