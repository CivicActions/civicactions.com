She helps craft content to highlight the services and leadership of CivicActions, bringing out the personalities and expertise of team members. She also brings project narratives to life, aligning them with business needs so they can be used across the organization for a variety of purposes.

Rachel has a MFA in printmaking and sculpture from University of Iowa. She loves doing things by hand, and has worked on publishing handmade artists books using 500-year-old printing technologies. Most evenings she can be found in her garage studio writing, drawing, and carving.
