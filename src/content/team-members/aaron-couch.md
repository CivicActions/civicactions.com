Aaron loves sharing technology for the greater good.

As the creator of [Project DKAN](https://getdkan.org/), he works with the development team to maintain a Drupal-based open data platform that allows organizations to publish and organize information. Aaronâ€™s innovative work in civic technology is backed by a fierce commitment to open source software and years of experience in Drupal development. 

Aaron has a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh. He is the founder of several companies and a lifelong advocate for social change. He lives with his partner, daughter, and cat in the Roxborough neighborhood in Philadelphia -- and occasionally works from the car so his daughter can take a nap in the carseat and his partner can catch a break.
