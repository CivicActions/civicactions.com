Beth appreciates well-written code and well-turned phrases.

When it comes to Drupal, she’s into a little bit of everything — helping teams create modules, conducting data migrations, building sites, and squashing bugs. Beth is an enthusiastic collaborator, and enjoys pair programming to work through problems. Her first development job was in the days before hard drives — since then she’s found many opportunities to put her technical skills to work for nonprofits and NGOs making the world a better place. 

Beth has a degree from the University of Florida and is an Acquia Certified Drupal Developer. She’s also a reader, writer, and traveler. Recent highlights include finishing Faulkner’s *The Sound and the Fury*, and getting lost on the way to the Parthenon.
