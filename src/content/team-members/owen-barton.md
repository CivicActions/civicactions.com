Owen has a lifelong love for technology as service.

He’s been programming since he was five. Now he touches all parts of development at CivicActions, from helping teams through the tough parts of major projects to creating technical tools and processes that benefit our clients and the greater open source community. Owen is perfectly at ease with both people and technology. His congeniality inspires both admiration and impish pranks from CivicActions engineers.

Owen has a B.S. in Environmental Science from Lancaster University. He taught math and science for three years in [Malawi](https://goo.gl/maps/YHWa5xdNnev), where he met his wife and developed a love for African music. He enjoys gardening and being outdoors — and has occasionally been known to work on proposals from beside a pond in the woods.
