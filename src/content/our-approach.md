Every project is about humans first —  the citizens and government employees whose daily lives will be affected by the quality of the work we do.   We combine this understanding with [our core values] and these methods:

### Partnership
We assemble a team that pairs our expertise with your knowledge. We agree upon a designated “product owner.” This person acts as the voice of your organization during day-to-day development activities. [add something about understanding stakeholder ecosystem]

### Discovery
Before building anything new, we learn about the current state of your service or system. Our team engages with your staff and users to develop a shared understanding of the problem we need to solve.

### Iteration
The product owner manages prioritization, while our technical and design leads oversee the development of prototypes. Throughout the process, we test our work with users to gather feedback and adjust course as needed. 

### Reflection
Our team meets at the end of each iteration to acknowledge successes, identify issues, and discuss ways to improve. We maintain a continuous improvement mindset throughout the engagement.
