### Approach

##### The following sections will be updated with DevOps stuff
By taking time to listen to the viewpoints and expertise of each stakeholder, we made sure the project addressed a shared goal that would support San Francisco as well as the larger ecosystem of health services in California.

##### Gain stakeholder buy-in
We demonstrated the value of the project through prototypes and webinars for stakeholders. In turn, county staff members and community based organizations promoted the project to their constituents as a valuable service.

##### Serving a diverse population 
Because EatFresh users speak multiple languages and use both phones and computers to access the internet, we built a site that users could access smoothly on any device in English, Spanish and Chinese. SMS features make it easy for users to share and save recipes by texting them directly from the site.

##### Location-based advice
We built the EatFresh site with the ability to auto-detect a person’s location so users can see geographically-specific resources like local farmers markets and nearby county offices. This helps remove barriers to accessing health services and nutritious foods.

##### Talk with real users
Our team interviewed county-level staff, food bank managers, and potential users at the HSA food stamp office to find out what was most important to them. We conducted usability testing and gathered feedback throughout the project.

##### Get the word out
To help spread awareness about EatFresh, we created a print campaign so people could be informed through postcards, bus posters, and flyers. We targeted our efforts toward the populations that would most benefit from the program.

I’ve gotten very positive and impressed feedback since the site’s launch. The CivicActions team members are superstars — they helped us meet our goals and create a user-friendly community site that will help us keep folks talking about nutrition!
