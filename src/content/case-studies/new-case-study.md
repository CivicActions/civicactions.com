  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) help millions of people every year find and enroll in health care programs. Planning a large-scale web and content management project to improve the customer experience of their multiple websites, the agency launched a design challenge for the vendors that were finalists for the contract.

  We did a fast-paced collaboration with our partners [Fearless](https://fearless.tech/) and [KPMG](https://www.kpmg.us/) to submit deliverables in just 8 business days (including page designs, content recommendations, an API, and a clickable prototype with a smart chatbot). Our team won the challenge because the agency saw we could help them achieve their goal to better serve Medicare beneficiaries.

  Within the time constraint for this compressed agile design sprint, we conducted lean versions of the activities we would normally do to make sure the site was effective for Medicare recipients. Daily collaboration among all team members, from Design to DevOps to Developers, allowed us to quickly test and iterate on every step. 

  We used [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/industries/government) as our preferred open source platform and the [CMS design system](https://design.cms.gov/), which builds on the U.S. Web Design System. Together, these tools provide a solid foundation for accessible [government websites](https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-government-accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281) — a key goal for agencies like CMS that serve diverse and aging populations.

  Human Centered Design played a critical role in our process of building a site that would be intuitive and useful to older Americans seeking information about their drug coverage options.
