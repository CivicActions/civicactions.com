background_section: "California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which serves 1.8 million people every month, was tasked with implementing a new law that would automatically register people to vote when they got a driver license. Forms needed to be updated to reflect the new policy and the system needed to be modernized to include an online option for license registration. We worked with the DMV to help them figure out how the new software systems would affect business workflows and front-line staff, and how California’s diverse population would understand and respond to the online forms. There was also a need to redesign the opt-out voter registration option in a way that respected sensitivities concerning the many undocumented immigrants in the state.

### Approach

##### Hands-on discovery
Before creating anything new, we went on “Service Safaris” and shadowed DMV employees to get a clear understanding of the workflows and to see how customers were experiencing service delivery.

##### Overcoming silos
We built relationships with policy makers and front-line workers so all the silos across DMV could benefit from our research learnings and understand each others’ needs for the new system and operations.
##### Fast, friendly support
Our support team provides empathetic and knowledgeable resolution of technical and login issues, often much faster than users expect! Educators feel supported and can get back to work quickly.

##### Government forms that make sense
Using [Plain Language Guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/), we created online and paper forms that help users understand the questions clearly, and were especially mindful in formulating content to serve non-citizen users.

##### Testing solutions with DMV staf
We created a mock field office at DMV headquarters to replicate an employee’s experience using the new system. DMV staff helped us understand how the technology updates would change their daily jobs.

##### Inclusive design for all users
We prioritized accessibility to make sure the system could be used by Californians across the spectrum of physical, cognitive, and emotional abilities. We relied on ARIA best practices and plenty of user testing.

##### Policy + user-centered design = effective programs
The Secretary of State’s staff was thrilled with the user-centered approaches we shared. They enjoyed talking with customers and learning how the content in government forms affects a person’s ability to vote or opt-out.

<blockquote>
We had a blast! This was such a new way of how to develop content for legislation.

### Impact
* DMV has a modernized driver license system with user-friendly forms
* Policy makers and DMV staff are collaborating more closely
* California can implement automatic voter registration through new DMV forms
* Higher voter turnout is predicted due to automatic registration
* Our human-centered processes were documented so the state can keep using them
