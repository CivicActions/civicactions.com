background_section: "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relies on its website to provide regulatory guidance to millions of visitors each year across various industries. The old, outdated site was hard to navigate for users seeking information and frustrating for stakeholders responsible for content management.

FCC needed a modern, mobile-responsive site that was both relevant to the public and easier to manage internally. CivicActions was engaged to build the new site within a fixed-scope contract on a tight timeline and budget while also addressing stakeholders priorities as they evolved.

### Approach

##### Bringing agile to government
We trained FCC in agile practices, communicating with the product owner and stakeholders throughout the project. Together we curated priorities, made sure the end result met real user needs, and helped the organization move away from traditional waterfall methodology.

##### Smooth content migration
We performed a massive content migration from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 and consolidated content from various legacy systems, with no disruption to FCC’s very active user community. 

##### Designing for users
We made the site more consistent by organizing the information architecture and also improved the search feature so visitors can quickly navigate to the resources they need. The user experience of FCC.gov is now as intuitive as modern consumer sites.

##### Simplified content management
We added access control to allow FCC’s many content creators to manage their own content without compromising the integrity of the site’s design. We also helped make the creation of content more pleasant and efficient by adding a robust text editor.

##### Accessibility for all users
FCC serves users with all levels of ability and is itself responsible for the accessibility of 21st Century communications. We scanned the site for compliance issues and resolved them. The current website serves as a model for [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

##### Testing to ensure quality code
To make sure all new code worked properly, we used Behat, a behavior-driven development testing framework that is written in English and can double as user acceptance test criteria. Behat tests were configured to automatically run when new code was merged. 

##### Turn-key solution for deployment
Due to security restrictions, we could not have full access to the production server, which made deployment of the new site complicated. We architected turn-key ways to deploy to production so the IT folks at FCC could do it themselves.
