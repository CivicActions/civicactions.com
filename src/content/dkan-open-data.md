We believe in the power of open data â€” standardized, machine-readable, trustworthy, and publicly accessible data that anyone can use and redistribute. When data is open, so are opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and innovation.

DKAN is a community-driven, Drupal-based open data platform used worldwide by governments of all levels, nonprofits, international organizations, and private companies.
