### Building a resilient government
The shift to remote or "telework" in response to COVID-19 has accelerated the understanding that we are at a point in the organizational and civic evolutionary cycle where a distributed team model will play a critical role in building highly-effective public service teams.

As civic leaders seek to address the issues of our times — disasters, pandemics, climate change, health and wellness, economic empowerment — distributed teams become the obvious solution for delivering responsive and resilient government services.


### Personalized training for your team

Distributed Teams Training provides government leaders and teams with strategies, tools, and best practices for working effectively in a distributed (remote/telework) model.
