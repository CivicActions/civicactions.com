#### Details

Based on CivicActions' 15+ years of working as a fully distributed team and the insights of remote-work mentor and expert John O’Duinn, we're offering a series of **FREE** webinars to provide practical information on making the transition from office-dependent work to distributed teams. Each session includes additional time to discuss questions about any top-of-mind concerns.
