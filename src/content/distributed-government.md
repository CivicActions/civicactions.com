The current operational challenges posed by the COVID-19 situation are just the latest example of why teams should be prepared to continue to work effectively even when they can’t get to their physical office buildings. Whether it’s a public health crisis, a forest fire, or just moving to a forward-thinking work culture, you should equip your teams to be effective in a remote or telework model.
