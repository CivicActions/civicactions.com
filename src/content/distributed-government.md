### Build resiliency and work remotely

Operational challenges posed by the current COVID-19 situation are just the latest example of why teams should be prepared to continue to work effectively even when they can’t get to their physical office buildings. Whether it’s a public health crisis, a forest fire, or just moving to a forward-thinking work culture, you should equip your teams to be effective in a remote or “telework” model.

### Free webinars

Based on CivicActions' 15+ years of working as a fully distributed team and the insights of remote-work mentor and expert John O’Duinn, we're offering a series of **FREE** webinars to provide practical information on making the transition from office-dependent work to distributed teams. Each webinar also includes additional time to help answer questions about any top-of-mind concerns. 

#### Who is it for?

Federal, state, county and/or local government employees who need to keep their teams operating as-normal-as-possible during rapid transitions from office-based work to distributed teams.
