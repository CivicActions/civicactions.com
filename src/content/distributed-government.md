### Build resiliency and work remotely

Operational challenges posed by the current COVID-19 situation are just the latest example of why teams should be prepared to continue to work effectively even when they can’t get to their physical office buildings. Whether it’s a public health crisis, a forest fire, or just moving to a forward-thinking work culture, you should equip your teams to be effective in a remote or “telework” model.

### Roundtable Exclusively for Executives in Federal Government

What are strategies for addressing morale and team connectedness? This roundtable will address issues around communications, coordination of work between team members, team accountability and trust.
