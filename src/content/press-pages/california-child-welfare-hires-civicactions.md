California’s Child Welfare Digital Service ([CWDS](https://cwds.ca.gov/)) project has [awarded](https://blog.cwds.ca.gov/cwds-awards-consulting-contract-to-civicactions/) an early contract for development operations to CivicActions. We’re thrilled to be part of this high profile effort to bring agile, user centered services to the state.
