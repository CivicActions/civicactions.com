### Make procurement work for government

Traditional procurement practices make it hard for government to effectively buy and implement modern IT services. As the tech landscape continues to evolve and public expectation of digital services increases, federal agencies must change the way they engage with industry and acquire technology. 

Our part-time DITAP training course helps you acquire the knowledge and skills needed for modern procurement in about 6 months.

### What you'll learn
#### Digital services in 21st century government
The basics of modern digital services such as agile software delivery, human centered design, cloud computing, and X-as-a-service

#### Understand what you are buying 
Skills to assess your customer’s needs, conduct market research, and figure out what digital solutions are the best fit

#### How to buy  
Developing an acquisition strategy that accounts for customer needs, your agency’s digital maturity, and what services are available on the market

#### Awarding digital service contracts 
Developing an acquisition strategy that accounts for customer needs, your agency’s digital maturity, and what services are available on the market

#### Leading change
Leadership and communication skills to help you be an ambassador for digital transformation and get stakeholder buy-in

### How you'll learn
#### Blended learning experience
The DITAP curriculum includes a variety of learning mechanisms such as group discussions, interviewing and shadowing assignments, live virtual classes and case studies, and other dynamic elements to help you master concepts and practice techniques.

#### Community focus
Our approach to DITAP is founded on the ethos of open sharing and collaboration essential to the success of digital service delivery.
