Digital transformation means that the way government delivers services to citizens is changing. But as agencies seek to modernize Federal digital services, relying on current procurement practices to navigate an evolving landscape of technologies presents problems. To deliver effective software, procurement officers need to be able to adapt standard practices for more flexible requirements informed by best practices for software development.

The USDS and Office of Federal Procurement Policy defined DITAP as a pilot community of informed IT acquisition professionals to develop expertise across government agencies. CivicActions Education Services offers DITAP training to support new procurement practices that not only deliver effective software, but transform the Federal approach to digital services.
