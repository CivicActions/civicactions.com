### Background

Traditional procurement practices lack the flexibility to help Federal agencies buy and deliver modern digital services. As the technological landscape continues to evolve and public expectation for government digital services increases, procurement officers need to learn how current regulations can be adapted to modular contracts and software development best practices.

The U.S. Digital Service and Office of Federal Procurement Policy created the Digital Information Technology Acquisitions Professional (DITAP) program as a pilot community of informed IT procurement specialists to build expertise across Federal agencies. CivicActions offers DITAP training to support the development of modern acquisition strategies for digital transformation.
